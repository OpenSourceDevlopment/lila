==================================

Lidraughts is a rewrite of [lichess/lila](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/) for international draughts (on a 10X10 board), including the variants [Frisian draughts](https://lidraughts.org/variant/frisian) and [antidraughts](https://lidraughts.org/variant/antidraughts).

It features [live games](https://lidraughts.org/?any#hook),
[tournaments](https://lidraughts.org/tournament),
[simuls](https://lidraughts.org/simul),
[tactics trainer](https://lidraughts.org/training),
[coordinates training](https://lidraughts.org/training/coordinate),
[studies / shared analysis](https://lidraughts.org/study),
[forums](https://lidraughts.org/forum) and
[teams](https://lidraughts.org/team).

The UI is currently available in 9 languages, translated with a varying degree of completeness: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian; and out of respect for Frisian draughts, also in Frisian!

Plans for the future include adding computer analysis, playing against the computer, an opening explorer and tablebases, and possibly more variants.

The source includes a draughts implementation of [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess/) in modules/draughts. The UI component [chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) is implemented for draughts as ui/draughtsground.
