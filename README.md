==================================

Lidraughts is a rewrite of [lichess/lila](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/) for international draughts (on a 10X10 board), including [frisian draughts](https://lidraughts.org/variant/frisian).

It features [live games](https://lidraughts.org/?any#hook),
[tournaments](https://lidraughts.org/tournament),
[simuls](https://lidraughts.org/simul),
[tactics trainer](https://lidraughts.org/training),
[coordinates training](https://lidraughts.org/training/coordinate),
[studies / shared analysis](https://lidraughts.org/study),
[forums](https://lidraughts.org/forum) and
[teams](https://lidraughts.org/team). The UI is available in English and Dutch.

Plans for the future include adding computer analysis, playing against the computer, and an opening explorer and tablebases.

The source includes a draughts implementation of [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess/) in modules/draughts. The UI component [chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) is implemented for draughts as ui/draughtsground.
